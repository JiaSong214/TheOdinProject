## What I Learned

### 1. Webpack

What is Webpack?
Webpack is module bundler. It bundle all javascript files to one file.

What does Webpack do?

1. In big project, you need to manage your code by module. (You don't have to remember every variable's name)
2. Web task manager: Webpack help you to compress, and compile files automatically. (You don't have to compress files and images, and compile SaSS all the time manually)
3. Fast loading speed: You can load each modules whenever you want.
